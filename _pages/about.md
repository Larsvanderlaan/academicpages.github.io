About me
======
I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Statistics Department at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am advised by Professors Alex Luedtke, Marco Carone, and Peter B. Gilbert. In 2019, I completed by B.S. in mathematics and physics at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. Afterwards, in 2020, I obtained a M.A. in Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley. In the past, I interned at Genentech and the Fred-Hutchinson Cancer Center where I developed and applied causal inference methods, and worked as an applied statistican under Professor Andres Cardenas at UC Berkeley's Department of Environmental Health Sciences.




Research Interests
======
My research interests are statistical-learning theory, semiparametric and nonparametric estimation and inference, and causal inference. Currently I am working on:
\begin{itemize}
\item A novel machine-learning paradigm for nonparametric estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects.
\item Causal inference for continuous treatment effect functions under nonparametric shape constraints (i.e. monotonicity and convexity)
\item Semiparametric selective inference for causal parameters after data-adaptive model selection.
\item Doubly-robust causal calibration of conditional treatment effect predictors.
\end{itemize}
